# In app scripting examples

## Priciples for making an example

* One folder per script example
* Demo data within the example folder, unless the script can be run with reasonably complete workbook.
* If there are any setup steps or paths to edit, indicate them in a readme.md file.
* Avoid saving example scripts within demo workbooks - this causes confusion if checked in versions ever supersed them.
